        <h2>There are many different kinds of climbing, but here are the basics:</h2>
        <h3>Aid VS Free Climbing</h3>
        <p>Free climbing does not mean climbing without a rope. That would be <em>free soloing,</em> the high-stakes
            activity made famous by Alex Honnold in his film, Free Solo. Rather, free climbing means the climber is
            simply trying to reach the top of his or her objective using only their physical bodies.</p>
        <p>Safety systems such as a rope or bouldering pad may be used in the event of a fall, but not to aid upward
            progress. In contrast, aid climbing means the climber uses a variety of technical gear to painstakingly pull
            themselves up the cliff.</p>

        <h3>Bouldering</h3>
        <p>Bouldering is climbing without a rope on small cliffs and boulders where it is possible to land relatively
            safely, first evolved on the boulders of Fontainbleau outside of Paris in the mid-century. Because
            bouldering allows the climber to practice intricate movements unencumbered by a rope or safety concerns, it
            is the premier venue for pushing the absolute limits of free climbing.</p>

        <h3>Sport Climbing AKA Lead Climbing</h3>
        <p>Sport climbing is where routes are pre-bolted with permanent anchors for safety, and climbers use quickdraws
            to attach their rope to the bolts as they ascend. Sport climbing is more of an umbrella term as it refers to
            different kinds of climbing, but sport and lead climbing are often used interchangeably.</p>

        <h3>Top Roping</h3>
        Top roping is a type of climbing where the rope is already fixed to the top of the route. The climber climbs
        while their belayer takes up the rope's slack as they ascend.
