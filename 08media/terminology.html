        <h1>Terminology</h1>
        <h2>If you're new to rock climbing, you may find the jargon confusing. This page will go over some of the most
            used terminology in climbing.</h2>


        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Beta:</h3>Any information about a specific climb, acting as advice or roadmap for the sequence of
                moves, holds, techniques, etc to complete it.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Project/Projecting:</h3>A <b>project</b> (noun) is a climb that is challenging for the climber,
                often above their current skill level or one they are aiming to complete. <b>Projecting</b>(verb) is the
                dedicated process of working on that climb. This involves repeated attempts, breaking it into smaller
                sections, practicing difficult moves, analyzing technique, etc. to successfully complete the climb.


            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Send:</h3>To successfully complete a climb from start to finish without falling or making errors
                that would negate the send.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Flash:</h3>To successfully complete a climb from start to finish on the first attempt without
                falling or making errors that would negate the flash.

            <li>
                <h3>Onsight:</h3>To successfully complete a climb from start to finish on the first attempt <b>without
                    any prior knowledge (beta) of the climb.</b>
            </li>


            <li>
                <h3>Crux:</h3>The single most difficult move or sequence of moves in a climb. This determins the overall
                grade (difficulty) of the climb.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Flag:</h3>A balancing technique where the climber extends a free leg out to the side of their body
                to counteract rotational forces and maintain balance.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Back Flag:</h3>A balancing technique where the climber extends their free leg behind the stabilizing
                leg and body to keep the hips closer to the wall and center of gravity over the base of support.


            <li>
                <h3>Barn Door:</h3>When a climber's body swings uncontrollably away from the wall, like a door on a
                hinge. This often leads to a fall.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Smear:</h3>A footwork technique used on featureless surfaces where there are no distinct holds. The
                climber presses their climbing shoe onto the surface, creating friction and pressure to then move off of
                that surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Dab:</h3>A term used for when a climber accidentally touches something outside of their designated
                climb, negating the send. Ex: touching the ground, holds not part of the climb, another person, etc.
                after already starting the climb.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Campus:</h3>The act of climbing without using your feet, moving from one handhold to the next using
                only your hands and arms, similar to monkey bars.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cross:</h3>A technique where a climber reaches one hand across (above or below) the other hand to
                reach the next hold.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Bump:</h3>A technique where a climber moves the same hand from one hold to another, effectively
                moving it twice in a row without any other hand movement in between.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Dead Point:</h3>A controlled, dynamic movement where a climber uses momentum to reach a hold that is
                just beyond their static reach, briefly pasuing at the peak of the movement before gracity fully takes
                over. This technique uses at least one point of contact, usually a foot on the wall, allowing for a
                powerful, efficient extension to the next hold without fully detaching.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Dyno:</h3>When a climber jumps from one hold to another, allowing all limbs to briefly lose contact
                with the wall.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Gaston:</h3>A movement where a climber pushes outwards on a hold with their thumb pointing down and
                palm facing away, rather than pulling inward. This technique creates outward pressure, like prying open
                elevator doors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Match:</h3>A movement where a climber places both hands or both feet on the same hold, often to
                switch hands or to prepare for the next move.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Top Out:</h3>To complete a climb by ascending over the top of the structure. Most common in outdoor
                bouldering, but not always applicable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Arete:</h3>An outward-facing, narrow ridge or sharp outside corner formed where two rock faces meet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Dihedral:</h3>An inside corner formed by two intersecting rock faces, resembling an open book shape
                where climbers use counter pressure with hands and feet on opposing walls to move up.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Slab:</h3>Noun: A wall angled less than 90 degrees. Verb: A style of climbing on a wall angled less
                than 90 degrees where the climber relies on balance, footwork, and friction rather than large handholds
                to ascend.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Overhang:</h3>A section of a rock or wall that leans backward from the vertical axis, meaning it is
                steeper than 90 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Vert (Vertical)</h3>A vertical wall that is essentially perpendicular to the ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cave:</h3>A rock wall formation that is a hollow space large enough for a person to enter. The
                climbs in a cave, extend up over the walls, creating overhang climbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Down Climb:</h3>The controlled act of descending a climb using only your own hands and feet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Heel Hook:</h3>A technique where a climber uses the heel of their foot to pull their body inward and
                towards the wall, using the heel to create tension, leverage, and stability on a hold.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Toe Hook:</h3>A technique where a climber uses the top of their toes and foot against a hold to
                create a stable, opposing force that helps maintain balance, increase reach, or pull themselves closer
                to the wall.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Knee Bar:</h3>A technique where a climber actively wedges their knee and foot against two opposing
                holds to create opposing forces, allowing them to rest their hands or to establish balance and placement
                for the next move.
            </li>
        </ul>
